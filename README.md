# Calculator and Triangle Classification - Java Unit Testing 

This project contains two small Java programs focused on developing unit testing skills using JUnit and writing clean, well-commented code according to the CCI Style Guide. 

## Project 1A: Calculator 
A simple calculator class that supports basic arithmetic operations: 
- Initial buggy implementation (used to practice debugging and Web-CAT feedback)
- JUnit test cases for all operations
- Final corrected version with full test coverage

## Project 1B: Triangle Classification

A program that classifies triangles based on their side lengths. It includes: 
- Logic to identify scalene, isosceles, and equilateral triangles
- Edge case handling for invalid triangle dimensions
- JUnit test cases with full code coverage

## Tools & Technologies 
- Java
- JUnit 4
- Netbeans
- Web-CAT feedback for style and testing validation

## Developed For 
-**ITSC 2214 - Data Structures and Algorithms 
-University of North Carolina at Charlotte 
-Instructor: Dr. Manuel A. Pérez-Quiñones
